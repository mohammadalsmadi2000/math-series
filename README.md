# Math Series

Math Series is a Python module that provides functions for generating Fibonacci series, Lucas numbers, and other related series.

## Installation

To install Math Series, simply clone the repository and import the module in your Python script:

git clone``` https://github.com/mohammadalsmadi2000/math-series ```

## Usage

### Fibonacci series
To generate the nth value in the Fibonacci series, call the fibonacci() function and pass the index as a parameter:
``` result = math_series.fibonacci(5) ```

### Lucas numbers
To generate the nth value in the Lucas numbers, call the lucas() function and pass the index as a parameter:
``` result = math_series.lucas(5) # Returns 11 ```

### Other series
To generate a series other than Fibonacci or Lucas, call the sum_series() function and pass the required index as the first parameter and the first two values of the series as the optional parameters:

``` result = math_series.sum_series(5, 2, 1) # Returns 18 ```
